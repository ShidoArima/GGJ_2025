Global Game Jam 2025 Project

Code is a total mess as it goes with gamejams. 

Areas to improve: 
- Optimize glass simulation by ComputeShaders or Job System
- Add proper StatMachine to control game state and UI
- Have a proper separation for scenes
- Remove tons of duplications and dependencies

Narative: 
- Add customers with their needs and behaviors
- Add types of glass
- Add various game loop constraints
