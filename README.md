Global Game Jam 2025 Project

Code is a total mess as it goes with gamejams. 

Areas to improve: 
- Optimize glass simulation by ComputeShaders or Job System
- Add proper StatMachine to control game state and UI
- Have a proper separation for scenes
- Remove tons of duplications and dependencies
- Propagate cancelation to tasks

Narrative: 
- Add customers with their needs and behaviors
- Add types of glass
- Add showcase shelf of previous crafts
- Add various game loop constraints
